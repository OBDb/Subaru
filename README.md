# Subaru

This repository contains default signal set configurations for Subaru vehicles. It serves as a fallback when a specific Subaru model does not have its own dedicated signalset definitions. The files are structured to provide general mapping that may work across multiple Subaru models, though dedicated model-specific configurations are preferred when available.

## About Subaru

Subaru is a Japanese automobile manufacturer founded in 1953 as a division of Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru Corporation). The company has built its reputation on several distinctive technologies and philosophies:

## Generations

### Early Years (1953-1970s)
Subaru began as a division of Fuji Heavy Industries, itself formed from the remnants of the Nakajima Aircraft Company. The company's first vehicle was the Subaru 1500, released in 1954. During this period, Subaru established itself with small, practical vehicles like the iconic Subaru 360 kei car and the Subaru 1000, which introduced what would become Subaru's signature technologies.

### Establishing Identity (1970s-1980s)
This era saw Subaru introduce its now-famous horizontally-opposed "boxer" engines and symmetrical all-wheel drive system. Models like the Leone established Subaru's reputation for practical, durable vehicles with excellent all-weather capability. The Subaru BRAT was introduced as a unique pickup truck alternative for export markets.

### Performance and Global Expansion (1990s-2000s)
Subaru gained worldwide recognition during this period through rally racing success with the Impreza WRX and its performance variant, the WRX STI. The Legacy and Outback models helped expand Subaru's market presence, particularly in North America where the raised wagon concept found a receptive audience looking for alternatives to traditional SUVs.

### Modern Era (2010-Present)
In recent years, Subaru has maintained its focus on all-wheel drive and boxer engines while expanding into new segments with vehicles like the BRZ sports car (developed jointly with Toyota), the three-row Ascent SUV, and electric vehicles through partnerships. The company has placed increased emphasis on safety technology through its EyeSight driver assistance system and has strengthened its commitment to outdoor lifestyle marketing.

## Key Technologies

- **Boxer Engines**: Subaru is known for its use of horizontally-opposed "boxer" engines in nearly all its vehicles. This design lowers the center of gravity and reduces vibration.

- **Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive**: A hallmark of most Subaru vehicles, this system provides balanced weight distribution and optimal power delivery to all four wheels.

- **EyeSight Driver Assist**: Subaru's advanced safety system uses stereo cameras to monitor the road and provide features like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and lane departure warning.
